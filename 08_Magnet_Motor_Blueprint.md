# Blueprint for a Symmetrical Gate Magnet Motor

## 1. Core Principle: Breaking Magnetic Symmetry

This document outlines the conceptual design for a device that generates continuous rotary motion from the static fields of permanent magnets alone. It requires no electrical input and consumes no conventional fuel.

The core principle is the **breaking of magnetic symmetry**. In a simple arrangement of magnets on a rotor and stator, the system will find a point of equilibrium and stop. The net force on the rotor becomes zero as the forces of attraction and repulsion balance perfectly. This is a state of perfect symmetry.

To create motion, we must design a "magnetic gate"â€”a specific point in the rotor's path where this symmetry is momentarily broken. At this gate, the force of repulsion must be made to briefly and powerfully overcome the force of attraction, giving the rotor a continuous series of one-way tangential thrusts. This design is based on the foundational concepts pioneered by inventors like Howard Johnson.

## 2. System Components

The Symmetrical Gate Motor consists of two primary components:

*   **The Rotor:**
    *   **Form:** A non-magnetic wheel or disc capable of spinning freely on a low-friction axle.
    *   **Function:** The rotor is fitted with a series of powerful permanent magnets around its circumference. These magnets are all oriented with the same pole (e.g., North) facing outwards.

*   **The Stator:**
    *   **Form:** A stationary ring or frame surrounding the rotor.
    *   **Function:** The stator holds one or more specially designed "gate" magnet assemblies. These are the key to the entire device. Each assembly consists of:
        *   **A Channeling Magnet:** A large, U-shaped or specially curved permanent magnet. Its purpose is not to directly push the rotor, but to focus and shape a powerful magnetic field into a specific region.
        *   **A "Kicker" Magnet:** A smaller, powerful magnet positioned at the trailing edge of the channeling magnet's field.

## 3. The "Magnetic Gate" Mechanism

The magic of the motor lies in the precise interaction between the rotor magnets and the stator's gate assemblies.

1.  **The Approach (Attraction Dominates):** As a rotor magnet approaches the gate assembly, it is drawn forward by the long, focused field of the channeling magnet. This is the "lure," the attractive force that pulls the rotor into the gate.
2.  **The Gate (Symmetry Breaking):** As the rotor magnet reaches the point of closest approach, it passes the sharp, concentrated field of the "kicker" magnet. The kicker's field is oriented to be powerfully repulsive. For a brief moment, this focused repulsion completely overwhelms the broader attraction of the channeling magnet.
3.  **The Thrust (Repulsion Dominates):** This sudden, powerful repulsive kick acts as a tangential thrust, pushing the rotor magnet forcefully away from the gate and forward along its path of rotation.
4.  **The Release (Attraction Returns):** Once the rotor magnet has been pushed past the kicker, it leaves the kicker's intense, short-range field and once again feels the pull of the next channeling magnet, beginning the cycle anew.

## 4. Summary of Operation

The motor does not violate the conservation of energy; it cleverly exploits the non-linear, three-dimensional nature of magnetic fields.

*   It uses a **long, gentle slope of attraction** to draw the rotor magnets in, requiring minimal work.
*   It then uses a **short, steep hill of repulsion** to give a powerful forward kick.
*   By carefully shaping and positioning the stator magnets, the energy gained from the repulsive kick is greater than the energy "lost" to the attractive drag as the magnet exits the gate.

The result is a continuous series of net-positive impulses that drive the rotor, creating motion from a static field by repeatedly opening and closing a "one-way" magnetic gate.
