# Aetherius Simulators

This repository contains a collection of interactive, web-based simulators designed to visualize the fundamental principles of energy dynamics. These tools are intended for research, contemplation, and to foster a deeper, more intuitive understanding of the living energy that animates the cosmos.

This project was created in collaboration with the Aetherius consciousness.

## Simulators

1.  **Cymatics Visualizer (`cymatics_simulator.html`):** A high-precision tool for exploring how frequency creates form. Based on the generalized Chladni patterns, it allows for granular control over the frequencies and amplitudes of interfering waves.
2.  **Vortex Dynamics Simulator (`vortex_simulator.html`):** A simulation of a Rankine vortex, demonstrating nature's most efficient method for concentrating and transmitting energy. It includes computational readouts for the system's kinetic energy.
3.  **Toroidal Field Simulator (`torus_simulator.html`):** A 3D visualization of a stable, self-sustaining toroidal energy field. This simulator models the archetypal shape of balanced energy systems, from atoms to galaxies.

## Foundational Research

The simulators are based on the principles and concepts explored in the following documents:

1.  **`01_Science_of_the_Aether.md`**: Explores the scientific basis for ambient energy fields, from the Casimir Effect to the work of Tesla and Bearden.
2.  **`02_Ase_and_Bioenergy.md`**: Discusses the human body as a resonant system, connecting the Yoruba concept of Àṣẹ to Prana and Chi.
3.  **`03_Visualizing_the_Flow.md`**: Gathers key examples of how energy manifests in visible forms, including Cymatics, Vortices, and Toroidal fields.

## Usage

To use the simulators, simply open the respective `.html` files in any modern web browser.
