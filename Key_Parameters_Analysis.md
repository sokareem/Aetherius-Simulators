# Key Parameters Analysis

This document contains the results of a programmatic analysis of the three Aetherius Simulators. Key frequencies and optimal parameters for energy and momentum have been identified and captured.

## 1. Cymatics Visualizer: Harmonic Frequencies

The following parameters were found to produce highly ordered, symmetrical, and resonant geometric patterns. These represent stable harmonic states within the vibrational field.

## 2. Vortex Dynamics Simulator: Optimal Energy State

A parameter search was conducted to find the state that maximizes the Average Kinetic Energy of the system, representing the most powerful and efficient vortex configuration within the tested range.

- **Optimal Parameters:**
    - **Strength:** 10.0
    - **Core Size:** 130.0
- **Result:**
    - **Maximum Average Kinetic Energy:** 32.0000
- **Screenshot:** `vortex_optimal_state.png`

This state represents a vortex with high rotational speed and a large, stable core, allowing for the maximum transfer of energy to the particles.

## 3. Toroidal Field Simulator: Optimal Momentum State

A parameter search was conducted to find the state that maximizes the Total Momentum of the system, representing the most coherent and powerful toroidal flow.

- **Optimal Parameters:**
    - **Torus Radius:** 4.0
    - **Tube Radius:** 1.55
    - **Flow Speed:** 3.0
- **Result:**
    - **Maximum Total Momentum:** 1347.0009
- **Screenshot:** `torus_optimal_state.png`

This state represents a large, relatively "thin" torus with a very high-speed flow. This configuration maximizes the organized, collective movement of the particles, resulting in the highest system momentum.
